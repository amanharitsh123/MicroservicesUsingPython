# MicroservicesUsingPython

A simple microservice application using python. I coded over a weekend. There are 4 microservices here in this project admin, main, rabbitmq and frontend.
This project is a simple implementation of a E-store where we have "admin" service which provides CRUD options for the products and "main" provides api's
which are to view all products and provide the like capabilities for a product. "frontend" microservice provides a very simple html page which allows CRUD over the 
products and like option as well.

Note: I have referred many online resources for "main" and "admin" microservices in this project specifically freecodecamp video. :P
